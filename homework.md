## Submission Instructions

## Homework Rules & Hints
 
A couple of **important rules** to make our lives easier:
 
 * See the [syllabus]({{ site.baseurl }}/syllabus/) for our [collaboration policy]({{ site.baseurl }}/syllabus/#collaboration-policy) and to learn how to [quote your sources]({{ site.baseurl }}/syllabus/#quoting-sources). 
 * We recommend you use version control while you are working on your homework using a private repository. GitHub offers [free private repositories for students](https://education.github.com/pack), [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) also provides free private repositories . Every time you are done with a chunk of work, or when you are done for the day, push your changes to a repository. This will avoid data loss, even if your house burns down, and you always will be able to recover what you already pushed. **Make sure that your work is NOT PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE**.
 * We will grade your work based on the IPython, Jupyter and library version introduced in the labs. Make sure that your code is compatible with these versions.
