The amount and complexity of information produced in science, engineering, business, and everyday human activity is increasing at staggering rates. The goal of this course is to expose you to methods and techniques that increase the understanding of complex data. Data Science is at the intersection of statistics, computer science, and a domain science.

In this course you will learn about the former two: statistics and computer science. The methods you learn about and the tools will get to know will help you do data analysis in your domain. 
 

The course begins by bootstrapping your coding skills, moves on to fundamentals of statistics, followed by the four main topics covered in the course:
 
  * **data wrangling**: how do I acquire, clean, reshape or sample data so that it's ready for further processing?
  * **data exploration**: how can we explore what's in the data?
  * **prediction**: given the data I have, can I make a judgment about other, similar data?
  * **communication**: how can you communicate your findings to others?

The course is offered in the fall term 2016 at the University of Utah cross-listed between math and CS Classes start on Monday, August 22.
